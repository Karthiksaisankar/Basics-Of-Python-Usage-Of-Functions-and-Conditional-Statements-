Based on which shape is chosed by the user, the program should ask for the appropriate input and print the resulting area on the screen.\n",

    "Create and encrypter in python based on the ceaser cipher. It is a substitution cipher where each character of the original text is shifted a certain number characters in the alphabet. Write a function that would require 2 arguments – the input text to be encrypted and a key. For eg: Given the input text ‘hello’ and the key 3, the resulting encryted text would be ‘khoor’. Here you can see that every character in the string hello is shifted by 3 characters. ‘h’ has shifted to ‘k’, ‘e’ has shifted to ‘h’ and so on. If a key of 5 were used, the resulting string would be ‘mjqqt’. This function should be capable of ignoring any characters which are not alphabets. Th2 character ‘z’ entered b\n",
